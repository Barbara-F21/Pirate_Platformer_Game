# Pirate-Treasure-Hunt
Platformer Game develloped in Java

Hi there! "Pirate Treasure Hunt" is a platformer game developed in Java. Basically you have to collect all the treasures with your little pirate while the crabs are trying to attack you. Be careful! There are traps as well (:. Reach the flag and get the highest score as possible. This game was inspired by a YouTube tutorial, which suggested a basic framework for its creation. This is an original project that includes my own ideas, creativity and implementations. Please do not copy this work.
